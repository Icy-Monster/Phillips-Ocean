This is an implementation of an Ocean-Spectra, the Phillips spectrum to be exact.It uses inverse fast Fourier transforms (FFT) to efficiently and quickly generate waves.
It uses the EditableMesh instance to its fullest, vertex’s positions and even normals are changed each time! It also includes a custom implementation of foam with EditableImages. 
The project offers wide customizations to artists, to get any type of sea environment that one may need— and it’s even fully open sourced, so anyone can take a look inside and see how it is made.

It also includes a custom Complex and (i)FFT module, that aggressively optimizes it for this use case.
